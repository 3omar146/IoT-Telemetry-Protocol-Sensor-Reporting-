# IoT Telemetry Protocol – UDP Client & Server

##  Overview
This project implements a simple **IoT Telemetry Protocol** where a **sensor client** sends telemetry packets to a **server** using UDP.  
It demonstrates two main message types:
- **INIT** – used by the client to register and initialize communication.
- **DATA** – used to transmit sensor readings to the server.

Both client and server are implemented in Python, and the client can optionally use a simple GUI for user interaction.

##  Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Required libraries (usually included in Python, but you can ensure with):
  ```bash
  pip install tkinter hashlib struct socket

How to Run the Project
Step 1 – Run the Server
  Open a terminal and start the UDP server:
    python server.py

  You should see output like:

  Server listening on port 5005...
  Received INIT from Device 101

Step 2 – Run the Client
  In another terminal, run the client:

  python client.py
This will send an INIT packet followed by DATA packets containing random sensor readings.
If you are using the GUI version:
python gui.py

Then use the “Send INIT” and “Send DATA” buttons to manually send packets.

## Expected Output

The server terminal displays received packets and logs them into SensorsLogs.csv.

The client terminal or GUI shows confirmation messages such as:

INIT packet sent successfully.
DATA packet sent successfully.

## Notes

You can modify the server IP and port in both server.py and client.py.

Both client and server must be on the same network for communication to work.

The log file (SensorsLogs.csv) will automatically be created and updated by the server.
