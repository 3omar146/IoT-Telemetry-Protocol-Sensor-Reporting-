# IoT Telemetry Protocol – UDP Client, Server & Dashboard

## 🧩 Overview
This project implements a simple **IoT Telemetry Protocol** where a **sensor client** sends telemetry packets to a **server** using UDP.  
It demonstrates two main message types:
- **INIT** – used by the client to register and initialize communication.  
- **DATA** – used to transmit sensor readings to the server.  

Both the **clients** and **server** are implemented in Python.  
Additionally, a **Dashboard GUI** is provided for easier control and visualization.

## 🧱 Requirements
Make sure you have **Python 3.8 or higher** installed.

Then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install rich matplotlib
```

*(If you’re using the dashboard, both `rich` and `matplotlib` are required.)*

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🖥️ Option 1 – Using the Dashboard (Recommended)
The dashboard can start and control the server and sensors directly.
It runs the baseline test required to check the system.
```bash
python dashboard.py
```

- This will open the **Dashboard GUI**.  
- From it, you can start the server and any available sensors.  
- **Note:** The dashboard currently supports **only one sensor of each type** at a time.  
- All data will be visualized and logged automatically.

---

### 🧾 Option 2 – Using the Terminal (Manual Mode)

You can also run the components manually without the dashboard.

#### Step 1 – Start the Server
In one terminal:
```bash
python Server.py
```

#### Step 2 – Run One or More Sensors
In separate terminals, start your sensors manually:
```bash
python TempratureSensor.py
python HumiditySensor.py
python PressureSensor.py
```
You can run **multiple sensor clients** at once (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) — each will send data independently.

---

## 📊 Output
- The **server terminal** or **dashboard** will display received packets.  
- Sensor data and metadata will be logged automatically into:
  ```
  SensorsLogs.csv
  ```
- The **dashboard** uses `matplotlib` for real-time visualization.

---

## 🛠️ Notes
- Ensure the **server and clients** are running on the **same network**.  
- You can change the server IP and port inside both `server.py` and `client.py`.  
- The log file (`SensorsLogs.csv`) is created automatically if not found.
